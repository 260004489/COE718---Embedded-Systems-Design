# COE718---Embedded-Systems-Design
This document contains the manual for COE718 course final project. Since we do not have access to hardware (physical board), the tasks in this final project are designed in a way to require minimum dependence on input and output to the board. However, the project will help you gain more knowledge about the ARM Cortex-M3 board and uVision.
